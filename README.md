**Advancing UN SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture through community-backed lending on VeChain.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

**VeFarmers** is a community-backed micro-lending platform that empowers local and small-scale farmers with fair and transparent access to loans. Built on **VeChain**, it enables community members to pledge **VET** in support of farmers, who can then access funds for seeds, labour, equipment, or land through integrated on/off ramps.

Pledgers earn **B3TR** token rewards based on the amount and duration of their VET pledge:

> **Reward = VET pledged √ó time elapsed √∑ reward rate**

The platform directly supports **UN SDG 2** by promoting food security, reducing reliance on centralized agribusiness, and strengthening local farming economies.
